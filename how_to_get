1. connect your ESP to which NTP server you want 
using AT command, NTP server uses UDP protocol.

select server in your region,go to
https://www.ntppool.org/zone/@

To make a request to server to get the seconds info 
you must send a 48  byte array of characters. 

important indexes of this array 0,1,2,3 and 12,13,14,15
rest is nnot important but i suggest that dont leave them NULL,
i had a problem and then assinged them 0xBA.
size is fatal, it must be 48 byte.

packetBuffer[0] = 0xE3;
packetBuffer[1] = 0;
packetBuffer[2] = 6;
packetBuffer[3] = 0xEC;
packetBuffer[12]  = 49;
packetBuffer[13]  = 0x4E;
packetBuffer[14]  = 49;
packetBuffer[15]  = 52; 
int i; 
for ( i=16;i<48;i++){
packetBuffer[i]=0xBA;
}
packetBuffer[4]=0xBA;
packetBuffer[5]=0xBA;
packetBuffer[6]=0xBA;
packetBuffer[7]=0xBA;
packetBuffer[8]=0xBA;
packetBuffer[9]=0xBA;
packetBuffer[10]=0xBA;
packetBuffer[11]=0xBA;

Then, ervver will response with string with length of more than 44. 
Seconds info iss hidden in indexxes 40, 41, 42 and 43.

to be continue...
